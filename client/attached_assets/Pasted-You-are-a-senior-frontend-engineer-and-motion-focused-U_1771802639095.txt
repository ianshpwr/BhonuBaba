You are a senior frontend engineer and motion-focused UI architect.

The Bhonubaba e-commerce storefront is already built with:

React (Vite)

TypeScript

TailwindCSS

Zustand / Context API

Fully responsive layouts

Component-driven architecture

Warm, cozy design system

Your task is to upgrade the existing project with advanced, visually engaging animations while maintaining:

Performance

Accessibility

Warm brand identity

Production-grade stability

This is an enhancement layer, not a redesign.

⚙️ Animation Tech Stack

Use:

Framer Motion for layout + entrance animations

CSS transitions for micro interactions

transform + opacity only for performance

Avoid layout-thrashing properties

Route-based page transitions

Lazy-loaded animation components

All animations must remain GPU-friendly.

🌤 1. Floating Warm Glow Background Layer

Add atmospheric floating pastel blobs to:

Homepage hero

Drop launch page

Requirements:

2–4 blurred gradient orbs

Very slow 20–40 second movement loop

Subtle parallax tied to cursor position

Low opacity (0.3–0.5)

Must not block interaction

Position absolutely and animate using translate3d.

✨ 2. Soft Morphing Buttons

Upgrade all primary buttons:

Hover:

Slight scale increase (1.02)

Soft shadow deepening

Gradient shift

Optional icon slide-in

Active:

Quick press compression (scale 0.97, 120ms)

Keep transitions under 250ms.

🫧 3. Staggered Product Grid Entrance

On PLP and homepage grids:

Fade in

Slight upward motion (20px)

Scale from 0.95 to 1

Stagger delay (0.05–0.08s per card)

Must trigger once on scroll into view.

🌸 4. Interactive Card Hover Highlight

Upgrade product cards:

Slight lift (translateY -6px)

Radial gradient hover highlight following cursor

Soft glow border on hover

Smooth 200ms transition

Do not over-intensify glow.

🌊 5. Scroll Section Reveal System

All major sections should:

Fade in

Slide upward 30px

Slight blur (4px → 0)

300–400ms transition

Use Intersection Observer or Framer Motion viewport detection.

🪄 6. Add-to-Cart Fly Animation

When clicking “Add to Cart”:

Clone product thumbnail

Animate shrink + move toward cart icon

Cart icon gently scales up then returns

Total duration under 450ms.

Must not block interaction.

🧁 7. Elastic Variant Selector

When selecting size/color:

Selected pill expands slightly

Other pills dim subtly

Soft glow animation

Light spring animation (low bounce)

🌷 8. Scroll Progress Bloom Indicator

Replace traditional progress bar with:

Circular bloom indicator in bottom corner

Fills based on scroll depth

Subtle color transition

2px ring thickness

Minimal footprint.

🌙 9. Time-Based Background Shift

Implement optional ambient background warmth shift:

Morning:

More peach tone

Evening:

Slight blush-lavender tone

Transition duration: 3–5 seconds.

Should be subtle and non-distracting.

💫 10. Wishlist Animation

When clicking wishlist:

Heart fills

Gentle pulse

Small sparkle burst

Duration under 400ms

🍃 11. Page Transition System

Add route transitions:

Outgoing page fades + slight blur

Incoming page slides up 20px

Maintain scroll reset

Duration: 300ms.

Use AnimatePresence.

🌼 12. Image Mask Reveal

On hero and drop images:

Rounded mask expansion reveal

Smooth bottom-up wipe

400ms duration

🧸 13. Cozy Loading State

Replace default loading spinner with:

Warm gradient background

Animated logo stroke draw

Friendly text: “Preparing something cozy…”

Must remain lightweight.

🌤 14. Gentle Floating Micro Illustrations

Add subtle animated elements:

Steam animation on cup product

Soft sparkle near CTA

Slight floating motion (6–10s loop)

Use keyframes.

🎯 Animation Governance Rules

To maintain brand consistency:

No aggressive bounce

No neon/glitch/cyber effects

Max 2 animated focal points per section

Keep motion subtle and warm

Use easing curves that feel natural

Respect reduced motion user preference

📂 Architecture Requirements

Create:

/animations

buttonAnimations.ts

pageTransitions.ts

gridStagger.ts

flyToCart.ts

glowBackground.ts

revealOnScroll.ts

All reusable animation configs.

🧠 Performance Safeguards

Disable heavy effects on low-end devices

Respect prefers-reduced-motion

Lazy load animation-heavy components

Avoid re-render loops

Test Lighthouse performance

📦 Final Deliverables

Update existing project with:

Animation system layer

Reusable motion utilities

Clean abstraction

No broken UX flows

Fully responsive behavior intact

This should feel premium, warm, and emotionally engaging without compromising usability or performance.
